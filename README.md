# Scoundrel Monte Carlo Simulation

Scoundrel is a single player card game that can be played with a standard 52 card deck of playing cards.
Scoundrel was created by Zach Gage and Kurt Bieg. You can find the rules to the game [here](http://www.stfj.net/art/2011/Scoundrel.pdf).

This repository uses monte carlo simulations to test various ways of playing Scoundrel in
order to see which one is most optimal.
